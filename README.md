- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Juan Jose, I'm a Software Engineer and an enthusiast about technology, always looking for new challenges related to my career.
  
- Iâ€™m interested in creating new tools that will provide knowledge and new skills not only for me as a Software Engineer but also for anyone looking for helpful information about software development.
- Iâ€™m currently learning about OOP concepts, Functional programming, SOLID principles, and scalable Software Architectures such as Clean Architecture, Domain Driven Desing, and Monoliths.  There is always the possibility learn Front-End frameworks (React, React Native ...)
